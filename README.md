Physics-Informed Gaussian Splatting
==================

Source code for my Master's thesis on solving partial differential equations with Gaussians and machine learning.

The thesis can be found [here](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:7069ec01-9b5e-4957-9af4-850c4cf32d20).

## Usage

First build and install the package in `diff-gaussian-sampling`.

Detailed instructions coming soon...
